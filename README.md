## Description
This is a simple, plug-and-play resource to provide server developers with a permission-based player blip system in FiveM.
This allows your staff to see all players on the server, and their location, on the mini-map and the pause menu.
Please note, there is a cap of around 4000 blips. This means, if you have a *ton* of blips already, some may not be rendered.
  
Via the config, you can easily:
- Modify the ACE permission required for using the command.
- Set the command name entered into the chat for enabling/disabling the player blips.

## Setup
1. Download!
1. Drag the folder containing the .lua files into your resources folder
1. Copy "default_config.lua" and rename the copy to "config.lua"
1. Open config.lua and modify settings to meet your requirements
1. Add `start knight-playerblips-lite` to your server.cfg
1. Enjoy!
